## Build

Test suites are built automatically by the [.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) action whenever a change are committed to the `main` branch.
A successful build results in a Docker container that is capable of running your tests on the CDP Platform and publishing the results to the CDP Portal.

## Run

The performance test suites are designed to be run from the CDP Portal.
The CDP Platform runs test suites in much the same way it runs any other service, it takes a docker image and runs it as an ECS task, automatically provisioning infrastructure as required.

## Local Testing with LocalStack

The `fcp-mpdp-performance-test-suite` can be ran locally via Docker compose.  
You will first need to run the service you wish to test against locally.  
Once this is complete, you can trigger a local test run:
```
./test.sh
```

Test reports are saved locally and can be viewed in `reports` directory.
